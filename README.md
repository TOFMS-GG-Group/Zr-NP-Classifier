# Zr-NP-Classifier
This app is used to classify Zr-rich particles measured by spICP-TOFMS as natural or anthropogenic based on recorded multi-elemental signatures.

Steps
1. Install streamlit, pycharm (or any other IED). Streamlit opens in a browser (for example: google chrome) and the browser acts as graphical user interface.
   IED can be used to read or edit codes.
2. Using Pycharm terminal open streamlit webapp on browser by typing "streamlit run Zrapp.py" and press enter. Here Zrapp is the name of the file that contains source codes.
3. Both source code file and helper file should be kept in the same folder.
4. Import all the libraries needed and install the packages.
5. Once you have running Zrapp, drag or upload the files that you want to classify.
6. A .csv file that contains critical values, sensitivities and ToF counts can be used for classfication of Zr particles.
7. Example .csv files are also given here.
